    <h1>Reading Response C</h1>
    <i>"It's not about collecting. I don't like to be a victim of my own obsessions in that way. It's more about working with groups of things, their arrangement, how they react."</i>

    <p>Having done a collection project centered on letters (a booklet for Intermediate GD), I think KM makes a great point here in emphasizing how things react and arrange with one another. Working through my assignment, I reached a point where I needed to intently consider the guidelines by which I would distinguish a "letter" from "not a letter." Whereas, at first, it was easy to focus on an object's form to make the distinction, other factors later emerged (i.e. how something reveals itself in light/shadow/motion, how legible a form remains when arranged with other forms, etc.). I think it's important to take the act of manipulation into account in collecting exercises, which requires some form of "working with" whatever atomic elements one collects.</p>

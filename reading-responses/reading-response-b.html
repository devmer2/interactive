    <h1>Reading Response B</h1>
    <ul>
      It makes sense that new products—the introduction of the automobile, the first computer UIs, the first mobile UIs—benefit from the communicative properties of a metaphor (hence the "horseless carriage," early iOS skeumorphism, etc). But eventually these products come to stand on their own, and new metaphors are added on, further abstracting concepts away from their origins. This is evident in the progression of trends (e.g. flat UI design) and even language (words derived from latin roots, memes, etc). I'm curious when this decision to abstract things further takes place. <br><br>
      <li>Does it depend solely on a general audience reaching a certain level of understanding, or do other factors come into play?</li>
      <li>Are there instances where people sacrifice effectiveness/efficiency (in a real or virtual world) to adhere more strictly to a metaphor or its origins? Does this serve as a net positive?</li>

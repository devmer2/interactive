    <h1>Reading Response A</h1>
    <i><p>There’s even the legend of the 10x programmer, an individual who is just that much more productive than the proletariat. There is evidence that some programmers are much more productive than their equally experienced peers; but other studies have found this to be engineering folklore. Ten is an order of magnitude in a discipline that uses orders of magnitude to estimate things. Ten is an attractive and thus suspicious number.</p>
    That said, the industry undeniably attracts brilliant thinkers. I’ve met a few. You can tell they’re brilliant because their solutions make you laugh and go, “Oh, I would never have thought of that.” The sparks in their brains jump some pretty wide gaps. They know more than the manuals. Some people put the time in; some people can’t help but be obsessed; and some people are just so damn smart that it’s a revelation to be around them.</i>

    <p>I feel like, generally, there is no alternative to putting the time in in order to reach a level of expertise in any discipline. It appears as 'second nature' to people when their habits have grown (from extensive practice and effort) to that point. I'd imagine there is no quick shortcut to becoming comfortable with programming. It just requires the time.</p>
